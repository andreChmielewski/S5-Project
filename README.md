# S5 Coding Project

## 🎯 Learning Objective
In the final sprint of the trimester, we addressed arrays. The aim of this assignment is to review arrays to have a more thorough understanding of them.

## 📝 Assignment Description

Write a small program that utilizes the previous coding we learned to make something fun and interesting. For this project, you can either start from scratch or reuse your old code. If you start from scratch, the program can be simple and small, as long as it incorporates all the coding requirements listed in the completion criteria. If you use your existing code, the project should meet the coding requirements, but also be really well polished and complete.

## ✅ Completion Criteria

Before you start, complete the following steps:
- [ ] import the project into your IDE,
- [ ] read over the assignment's grading rubric on Canvas,
- [ ] accept the Academic Honesty Guidelines in 'worksCited.md',
- [ ] make your first commit to your GitHub project.

The coding project should be a game or useful application that meets the following requirements:
- [ ] be object-oriented and use data encapsulation,
- [ ] contain and use arrays to store and access data,
- [ ] be sufficiently complex* and use new and past coding concepts, 
- [ ] have a short video explaining what the program does and showing how it works (between 2-5 min)

_* The code for this project should be more complex than past projects. This criteria is left open vague on purpose._

Final checklist
- [ ] Make regular commits of your code to the GitHub repo,
- [ ] Add a link to the video you made below.
