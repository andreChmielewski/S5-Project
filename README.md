# S5 Exhibition of Learning

## üéØ Learning Objective
In the final sprint of the trimester, we addressed arrays. The aim of this assignment is to review arrays to have a more thorough understanding of them.

## üìù Assignment Description

Your friend has written you for help with writing their Java program. They want to know how they can start using large amounts of data without having too many variables. You, of course, have recommended using arrays. Record a video where you recommend arrays to your friend and explain how to use them. See the complete criteria below for more details.

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria

Before you start, complete the following steps:
- [ ] import the project into your IDE,
- [ ] read over the assignment's grading rubric on Canvas,
- [ ] accept the Academic Honesty Guidelines in 'worksCited.md',
- [ ] make your first commit to your GitHub project.

The video should be addressed to a friend advising them on how to use arrays to solve the problem of storing and accessing large amount of data in their coding project. The EOL should answer the following:

- [ ] What are arrays and how are they useful?
- [ ] In what ways can arrays be created in Java and what kind of data can they store?
- [ ] How can data be accessed and stored in an already existing array in Java?
- [ ] How can an array be traversed using a _for_ or _while_ loop?
- [ ] What's an enhanced _for_ loop and how can it be used to access an array?
- [ ] What are some errors that you might encounter when working with arrays?

Demonstrate how standard algorithms can use arrays to...
- [ ] Determine a minimum or maximum value
- [ ] Compute a sum, average, or mode
- [ ] Determine if at least one element has a particular property
- [ ] Determine if all elements have a particular property
- [ ] Access all consecutive pairs of elements
- [ ] Determine the presence or absence of duplicate elements
- [ ] Determine the number of elements meeting  specific criteria

Final checklist
- [ ] Commit any code your write for your EOL here to this GitHub repo,
- [ ] Add a link to the video you made below.
