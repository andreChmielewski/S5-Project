## üòá Academic Honesty Guidelines

There are TONS of online tutorials on how to code many simple and sophisticated programs. It's appropriate (and even encouraged) that you look over these resources for inspiration as well as coding guidance. Professional developers use Google, Stack Overflow, and online tutorials to inform their work. All this said, academic dishonesty and plagiarism are still concerns at any school - students should not be presenting others' work as their own. To ensure you are on the right path, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Research and attribute source** - As you use resources you find on the web, add them to the Works Cited section below.
2. **Copy with care** - Avoid copying more than a statement at a time, i.e. usually a line of code.
3. **Get help, but do your own work** - Get help from other students, but others aren't allowed to do your project for you.
4. **Commit regularly** - Commit your code to GitHub at the end of every coding session so that the evolution of your code is visible.
